###to start compile and running this project
please just clone this repostitory with this link : 
1. https://github.com/noveriojoee/MusicPlayer.git
2. go into project directory and start download the cocoapods with "pod install"
3. and do "pod update"
4. and start your "command + R" :D
5. You can check my first commit on branch "main_v1.0" and the feedbacks item are on "main_v2.0" branch and also this "main" branch are based on "main_v2.0" branch.

also download the uiComponent framework in here
https://github.com/noveriojoee/UIComponents.git

because i'm also practicing a little bit micro-frontend kind of things, so i start to seperate a dependencies module for a long term use, so the UIComponents its so called a UI Clothes for the apps. it controll the UI Behavior and components
and the MusicPlayer is the app itself.


thanks

:D
