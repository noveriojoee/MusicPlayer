# MusicPlayer

hi, here i'm writing code using itunes api search to play some music,
i'm writing the code using MVVM pattern here..
and to start compile and running this project,

please just clone this repostitory with this link : 
1. https://github.com/noveriojoee/MusicPlayer.git
2. go into project directory and start download the cocoapods with "pod install"
3. and do "pod update"
4. and start your "command + R" :D

also download the uiComponent framework in here
https://github.com/noveriojoee/UIComponents.git

because i'm also practicing a little bit micro-frontend kind of things, so i start to seperate a dependencies module for a long term use, so the UIComponents its so called a UI Clothes for the apps. it controll the UI Behavior and components
and the MusicPlayer is the app itself.


thanks

:D
